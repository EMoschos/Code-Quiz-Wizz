# Structure
I decided to build majority of the structure in HTML by hiding containers and using JS to display or hide when required.
This allowed me to build the page that is responsive by utilising bootstrap.  

# Fucntionality
The quiz questions are dynamically displayed and the user is notified if the answer was correct or incorrect.  I apllied a time penalty for incorrect answers of 15 secs
Once all questions have been answered or time runs out the highscores page is displayed.  You will only be able to log a score if you answer all questions and there is still time on the clock which then represents the users score
The user logs there score with the ability to remove if they like.  If the browser is refreshed the last score will still be displayed if it was not removed by the user. 
I have set the quiz so only the very last score that was 'saved' will be displayed.
